# OpenXAI : Towards a Transparent Evaluation of Model Explanations

We introduce OpenXAI, a general-purpose lightweight library that provides a comprehensive list of functions to systematically evaluate the quality of explanations generated by attribute-based explanation methods on structured data. The library provides a pipeline where new datasets (both synthetic and real-world), explanation methods, and performance metrics can be easily integrated.
